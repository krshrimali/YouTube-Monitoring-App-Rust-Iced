# YouTube Monitoring App (using Rust)

## Description

**NOTE:**: Another version of this project is present here: https://github.com/krshrimali/youtuber-monitoring-app.

This app is built on the top of [iced library](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced).

If you're curious what this is about, check out the [YT monitoring App stream series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfjzHJeA53gS-RyxHcpNdf85Q4tR_ZJ6_) on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/kushashwaraviShrimali).

## Instructions

Assuming you have `cargo` installed and rust setup, following Instructions should work:

```bash
cargo build
cargo run --release
```

If you are on Linux, you might have to install some extra dependencies before doing `cargo run --release`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install cmake, pkg-config
sudo apt install fontconfig libfontconfig-dev
```
